    "title": "About The Unit",
    "about-the-unit": "The Unit is the list of <b>top cryptocurrencies</b> used to create UNIT. UNIT is both the <b>first unbiased unit of account</b> and <b>crypto's first unbiased benchmark</b>. \n\nWe foresee a future where people no longer depend on central banks’ fiat currency as the value benchmark. As we journey further into an era of increasing <b>decentralization</b> and <b>disintermediation</b>, we believe that an unbiased standard is emerging and that standard is <b>UNIT</b>.",
    "faq": "FAQ",
    "faq-what-is-the-unit": "What is The Unit and how does it work?",
    "ans-what-is-the-unit": "The Unit is a set of cryptocurrencies coming from an <b>Open Selection Criteria</b> and glued together through an <b>Open Algorithm</b>.\n\nThe Unit aggregates data of the coins that satisfy the <b>selection criteria</b>. It then uses the <b>total human population</b> and <b>average life expectancy at birth</b> to create a unit of value called <b>UNIT</b>.",
    "faq-what-is-unit": "What is UNIT?",
    "ans-what-is-unit": "UNIT is an <b>unbiased unit of account</b> and the name of the token that follows its value.",
    "faq-is-unit-money": "Is UNIT money?",
    "ans-is-unit-money": "Money has taken many forms through the ages, but it consistently has <b>three functions</b>: unit of account, medium of exchange, and store of value. None of the cryptocurrencies that exist today achieve all three aspects.\n\nUNIT aims at fulfilling the <b>unit of account function of money</b>. Once the crypto space grows enough to serve as the world's financial system, UNIT can also be a <b>standard for deferred payments</b>.",
    "faq-what-features-the-unit": "What features make The Unit unique?",
    "ans-what-features-the-unit": "Unlike all previous coin sets, <b>The Unit</b> is <b>decentralized</b> in its <b>self-adjusting selection criteria</b> and its <b>open algorithm</b>. It is also the first set to produce an <b>unbiased unit of account</b>.",

    "ans-what-mission": "<b>Unite Crypto</b>",
    "faq-what-features-unit": "What features make UNIT unique?",
    "ans-what-features-unit": "Unlike all previous units of account, <b>UNIT</b> is not primarily a currency; it is an unbiased unit derived from the most important cryptocurrencies. In this way, UNIT doesn't choose winners or losers and instead <b>focuses on the most important portion</b> of the fungible decentralized cryptocurrency market."
