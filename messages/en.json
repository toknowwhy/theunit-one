    "about-the-unit": "A list of <important>top cryptocurrencies</important> creates UNIT. UNIT is both the <important>first unbiased unit of account</important> and <important>crypto's first unbiased benchmark</important>. \n\nWe foresee a future where people no longer depend on central banks’ fiat currency as the value benchmark. As we journey further into an era of increasing <important>decentralization</important> and <important>disintermediation</important>, we believe that an unbiased standard is emerging and that standard is <important>UNIT</important>. \n\nSince UNIT is a pure unit of account and <important>not a currency</important>, we created <important>TINU</important>, the first token pegged to the value of the benchmark. To mint TINU, enter our <important>vaults</important>, and boost your returns with UN rewards using our <important>farms</important>.",

    "faq-what-is-the-unit": "What is UNIT?",
    "ans-what-is-the-unit": "<important>UNIT</important> is an unbiased unit of account created from a set of cryptocurrencies coming from an <docsSelectionCriteria>Open Selection Criteria</docsSelectionCriteria> and glued together through an <docsAlgorithm>Open Algorithm</docsAlgorithm> that includes the <important>total human population</important> and the <important>average life expectancy at birth</important>.",
    "faq-what-is-unit": "What is TINU?",
    "ans-what-is-unit": "<important>TINU</important> is a token <important>pegged</important> to <important>UNIT</important> that can only be issued through our vaults. Its name comes from reversing the order of the letters in UNIT and contains the magical word inu.",
    "faq-is-unit-money": "Is UNIT money?",
    "ans-is-unit-money": "Money has taken many forms through the ages, but it consistently has <important>three functions</important>: unit of account, medium of exchange, and store of value. None of the cryptocurrencies that exist today achieve all three aspects.\n\nUNIT aims at fulfilling the <important>unit of account function of money</important> but not the other two. Once the crypto space grows enough to serve as the world's financial system, UNIT can also be a <important>standard for deferred payments</important> which is a subfunction of a unit of account.",
    "faq-what-features-the-unit": "What features make UNIT unique?",
    "ans-what-features-the-unit": "Unlike all previous units of account, <important>UNIT</important> is not primarily a currency; it is an unbiased unit derived from the most important cryptocurrencies. In this way, UNIT doesn't choose winners or losers and instead <important>focuses on the most important portion</important> of the fungible decentralized cryptocurrency market.",

    "faq-what-features-unit": "UNIT is the First Just Unit of Account, what does \"Just\" here mean?",
    "ans-what-features-unit": "The term \"Just\" in this context carries two meanings. Firstly, it implies that <important>UNIT</important> is an <important>unbiased unit of account</important>. Secondly, it refers to <important>UNIT</important> only being a <important>pure unit</important>. It's not a currency, instead, it provides a steady benchmark in the crypto world."
