    "about-the-unit": "The Unit is the list of <important>top cryptocurrencies</important> used to create UNIT. UNIT is both the <important>first unbiased unit of account</important> and <important>crypto's first unbiased benchmark</important>. \n\nWe foresee a future where people no longer depend on central banks’ fiat currency as the value benchmark. As we journey further into an era of increasing <important>decentralization</important> and <important>disintermediation</important>, we believe that an unbiased standard is emerging and that standard is <important>UNIT</important>.",

    "faq-what-is-the-unit": "What is The Unit and how does it work?",
    "ans-what-is-the-unit": "The Unit is a set of cryptocurrencies coming from <docsSelectionCriteria>Open Selection Criteria</docsSelectionCriteria> and glued together through an <docsAlgorithm>Open Algorithm</docsAlgorithm>.\n\nThe Unit aggregates data of the coins that satisfy the <important>selection criteria</important>. It then uses the <important>total human population</important> and <important>average life expectancy at birth</important> to create a unit of value called <important>UNIT</important>.",
    "faq-what-is-unit": "What is UNIT?",
    "ans-what-is-unit": "UNIT is an <important>unbiased unit of account</important> and <important>the name of the toke</important> that follows its value.",
    "faq-is-unit-money": "Is UNIT money?",
    "ans-is-unit-money": "Money has taken many forms through the ages, but it consistently has <important>three functions</important>: unit of account, medium of exchange, and store of value. None of the cryptocurrencies that exist today achieve all three aspects.\n\nUNIT aims at fulfilling the <important>unit of account function of money</important>. Once the crypto space grows enough to serve as the world's financial system, UNIT can also be a <important>standard for deferred payments</important>.",

    "ans-what-features-the-unit": "Unlike all previous coin sets, <important>The Unit</important> is <important>decentralized</important> in its <important>self-adjusting selection criteria</important> and its <important>open algorithm</important>.

    "faq-what-features-unit": "What features make UNIT unique?",
    "ans-what-features-unit": "Unlike all previous units of account, <important>UNIT</important> is not primarily a currency; it is an unbiased unit derived from the most important cryptocurrencies. In this way, UNIT doesn't choose winners or losers and instead <important>focuses on the most important portion</important> of the fungible decentralized cryptocurrency market."
